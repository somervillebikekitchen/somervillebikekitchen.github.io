Please sign up for your first open shop by looking for an unscheduled day when

Thanks, and see you soon!

<h3 id="organizing-events">Organizing events</h3>
<p>Events increase popularity and, indirectly, membership.  They facilitate
interaction between members of the local cycling community.  Generally, there
are two types of events: social events and workshops.  If you are trying to
organize an SBK event, see instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the person who will run the event, or the presenter. Work with the
    presenter to decide on the best time(s) for the event.  The event may be
    multipart (span across multiple days, e.g. introduction session, dirty
    hands session, advanced topics session).</li>
<li>Write short descriptions (short paragraph) for each session/day of the event.</li>
<li>[optional] Create a flyer for the event.
    <a href="/files/bike_in_movie_breaking_away.pdf">EXAMPLE FLYER</a></li>
<li>Add the event to the SBK website.  Make a new event page for each
    session/day of the event.
    <a href="https://github.com/somervillebikekitchen/somervillebikekitchen.github.io/blob/master/README.txt#L1">INSTRUCTIONS</a>.
    Contact Troy for help.</li>
<li>Send an announcement e-mail to the <strong>discuss@</strong> mailing list.
    Aggregate the descriptions for all sessions/days of the event and send one
    e-mail.  Touch on the following topics: introduction, rationale, sessions,
    rsvp request (usually informal), admission fee (usually free with suggested
    donation of $10), and any help needed from the community (e.g. we may need
    to borrow tools).  Remember to attach the flyer, if there is one.</li>
<li>[optional] Re-send the announcement e-mail to other mailing lists as you see fit
    (<em>do not</em> include multiple lists in the same e-mail). Use your best
    judgement to determine which additional mailing lists will find this event
    relevant.</li>
<li>[optional] Create a facebook event.  Remember to attach the flyer, if there
    is one.  Contact Val for help.</li>
<li>[optional] Create a twitter post.  Remember to attach the flyer, if there
    is one. Contact Jenny for help (search your inbox for Jenny's e-mail
    address).</li>
</ol>
