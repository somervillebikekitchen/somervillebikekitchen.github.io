<h3>How to host open shop:</h3>
<ol>
<li>arrive on time to unlock.</li>
<li>put out the sign (usually a whiteboard propped up on a chair).</li>
<li>at the end of open shop:
  <ul>
  <li>put away the tools.</li>
  <li>count the money in the "contributions" box and transfer it to the money jar.</li>
  <li>record the amount transferred in the notepad on the wall.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

</ol>

<p>If you can't make your scheduled shift, please notify staff@ soon so we can
find somebody to cover.</p>

<h3 id="buying-things">Buying Things</h3>
If you have identified a need for a bike tool, promotional material, etc.,
follow these instructions:
<ol>
<li>Send an email to <strong>staff@</strong> stating your request.</li>
<li>Use your best judgement to determine consensus.</li>
<li>Make the purchase, and keep the receipt.</li>
<li>Contact Luis for reimbursement.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="organizing-events">Organizing Events</h3>
<p>Events increase popularity and, indirectly, membership.  They facilitate
interaction between members of the local cycling community.  Generally, there
are two types of events: social events and workshops.  If you are trying to
organize an SBK event, see instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the person who will run the event, or the presenter. Work with the
    presenter to decide on the best time(s) for the event.  The event may be
    multipart (span across multiple days, e.g. introduction session, dirty
    hands session, advanced topics session).</li>
<li>Write short descriptions (short paragraph) for each session/day of the event.</li>
<li>[optional] Create a flyer for the event. For help, contact Yurij, Luis, and Troy.
    <a href="/files/bike_in_movie_breaking_away.pdf">EXAMPLE FLYER</a></li>
<li>Add the event to the SBK website.  Make a new event page for each
    session/day of the event.
    <a href="https://github.com/somervillebikekitchen/somervillebikekitchen.github.io/blob/master/README.txt#L1">INSTRUCTIONS</a>.
    Contact Troy for help.</li>
<li>Send an announcement e-mail to the <strong>discuss@</strong> mailing list.
    Aggregate the descriptions for all sessions/days of the event and send one
    e-mail.  Touch on the following topics: introduction, rationale, sessions,
    rsvp request (usually informal), admission fee (usually free with suggested
    donation of $10), and any help needed from the community (e.g. we may need
    to borrow tools).  Remember to attach the flyer, if there is one.</li>
<li>[optional] Re-send the announcement e-mail to other mailing lists and
    internet communities as you see fit (<em>do not</em> include multiple lists
    in the same e-mail). Use your best judgement to determine which additional
    mailing lists will find this event relevant.
    <ul>
    <li><strong><span class="email-address">bcn _at_ lists (dot) bostoncoop (dot) net</span></strong> -

    </ul>
</li>
<li>[optional] For social events, notify the <em>Somerville Bicycle
    Committee</em> about the event so they can put it on their public calendar
    and distribute the event notification to all Somerville cyclists.</li>
