<a href="#organizing-events"><h3 id="organizing-events">Organizing Events</h3></a>
<p>Events increase popularity and, indirectly, membership.  They facilitate
interaction between members of the local cycling community.  Generally, there
are two types of events: social events and workshops.  If you are trying to
organize an SBK event, see instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a day(s). Generally:
    <ul>
    <li>Monday nights are reserved for folk music</li>
    <li>Last Wednesday nights the downstairs area is reserved for cryptoparty</li>
    <li>Saturdays from 13:00-17:30 the upstairs area is reserved for <a href="http://www.boslab.org/">BOSLAB</a></li>
    <li>4th Tuesday of the month from 18:30-21:30 the upstairs area is reserved for <a href="http://www.boslab.org/">BOSLAB</a></li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Notify Shaunalynn (part of the Sprout team) to make sure that there will be
    no schedule conflicts.  Provide the date and time that we are planning to
    hold the event. E-mail
    <strong>
    <span class="email-address">shaunalynn _at_ thesprouts (dot) org</span>
    </strong>
    </li>
<li>Write short descriptions (short paragraph) for each session/day of the event.</li>
<li>[optional] Create a flyer for the event. For help, contact Yurij, Luis, and Troy.
    <a href="/files/bike_in_movie_breaking_away.pdf">EXAMPLE FLYER</a></li>
<li>Add the event to the SBK website.  Make a new event page for each
    session/day of the event.
    <a href="https://github.com/somervillebikekitchen/somervillebikekitchen.github.io/blob/master/README.txt#L20">INSTRUCTIONS</a>.
    Contact Troy for help.</li>
<li>Send an announcement e-mail to the <strong>discuss@</strong> mailing list.
    Aggregate the descriptions for all sessions/days of the event and send one
    e-mail.  Touch on the following topics: introduction, rationale, sessions,
    rsvp request (usually informal), admission fee (usually free with suggested
    donation of $10), and any help needed from the community (e.g. we may need
    to borrow tools).  Remember to attach the flyer, if there is one.</li>
<li>[optional] Re-send the announcement e-mail to other mailing lists and
    internet communities as you see fit (<em>do not</em> include multiple lists
    in the same e-mail). Use your best judgement to determine which additional
    mailing lists will find this event relevant.
    <ul>
    <li><strong><span class="email-address">bcn _at_ lists (dot) bostoncoop (dot) net</span></strong> -
	post to the <em>Boston Coop Network</em> mailing list if it is a social event
        (such as bike-in movie).</li>
    <li><strong><span class="email-address">bostonareafamilybike _at_ googlegroups (dot) com</span></strong> -
	post to the <em>Boston Area Family Bikes</em> mailing list if it is a social
        event (such as bike-in movie).</li>
    <li><strong><span class="email-address">discuss _at_ artisansasylum (dot) com</span></strong> -
	post to the <em>Artisans Asylum</em> mailing list for events that makerspace and
        hacker folk may find interesting.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>[optional] For social events, notify the <em>Somerville Bicycle
    Committee</em> about the event so they can put it on their public calendar
    and distribute the event notification to all Somerville cyclists.</li>
<li>[optional] Create a Facebook event.  Remember to attach the flyer, if there
    is one.  Contact Val for help.</li>
<li>[optional] Create a twitter post.  Remember to attach the flyer, if there
    is one. Contact Jenny for help (search your inbox for Jenny's e-mail
    address).</li>
<li>If it will be a large, long-running social event (e.g. movie night), be
    sure to notify the neighbors of Sprout.  Employ the rest of SBK staff to
    help.  Finish this at least one day before the event! </li>
</ol>
