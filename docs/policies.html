<p>Staff members are expected to follow these policies and instructions.</p>

<h3>How to contact other staff:</h3>

Simply send mail to staff@.  All staff will receive mail sent to staff@.

<h3>How to host open shop:</h3>
<ol>
<li>arrive on time to unlock.</li>
<li>put out the sign (usually a whiteboard propped up on a chair).</li>
<li>at the end of open shop:
  <ul>
  <li>put away the tools.</li>
  <li>count the money in the "contributions" box and transfer it to the money jar.</li>
  <li>record the amount transferred in the notepad on the wall.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>lock up.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can't make your scheduled shift, please notify staff@ soon so we can
find somebody to cover.</p>

<h3 id="buying-things">Buying Things</h3>
If you have identified a need for a bike tool, promotional material, etc.,
follow these instructions:
<ol>
<li>Send an email to <strong>staff@</strong> stating your request.</li>
<li>Use your best judgement to determine consensus.</li>
<li>Make the purchase, and keep the receipt.</li>
<li>Contact Luis for reimbursement.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="organizing-events">Organizing Events</h3>
<p>Events increase popularity and, indirectly, membership.  They facilitate
interaction between members of the local cycling community.  Generally, there
are two types of events: social events and workshops.  If you are trying to
organize an SBK event, see instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a day.  If this event is a workshop, work with the presenter to decide
    on the best day for the event.  The event may be multipart (span across
    multiple days).  For social events, try to recruit one or two more staff
    members to help setup and cleanup (so make sure they will be
    available on that day). Generally:
    <ul>
    <li>Monday nights are reserved for folk music</li>
    <li>Tuesday nights are reserved for <a href="http://www.boslab.org/">BOSLAB</a></li>
    <li>Sunday afternoons are reserved for Honk</li>
    <li>Sunday evenings are reserved for Sprout</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Notify Sprout so they know that the downstairs area will be unavailable.
    email them at: <br>
    <strong>
    <span class="email-address">three-two-one.contact _at_ thesprouts (dot) org</span>
    </strong>
    </li>
<li>Write short descriptions (short paragraph) for each session/day of the event.</li>
<li>[optional] Create a flyer for the event. For help, contact Yurij, Luis, and Troy.
    <a href="/files/bike_in_movie_breaking_away.pdf">EXAMPLE FLYER</a></li>
<li>Add the event to the SBK website.  Make a new event page for each
    session/day of the event.
    <a href="https://github.com/somervillebikekitchen/somervillebikekitchen.github.io/blob/master/README.txt#L1">INSTRUCTIONS</a>.
    Contact Troy for help.</li>
<li>Send an announcement e-mail to the <strong>discuss@</strong> mailing list.
    Aggregate the descriptions for all sessions/days of the event and send one
    e-mail.  Touch on the following topics: introduction, rationale, sessions,
    rsvp request (usually informal), admission fee (usually free with suggested
    donation of $10), and any help needed from the community (e.g. we may need
    to borrow tools).  Remember to attach the flyer, if there is one.</li>
<li>[optional] Re-send the announcement e-mail to other mailing lists and
    internet communities as you see fit (<em>do not</em> include multiple lists
    in the same e-mail). Use your best judgement to determine which additional
    mailing lists will find this event relevant.
    <ul>
    <li><strong><span class="email-address">bcn _at_ lists (dot) bostoncoop (dot) net</span></strong> -
	post to the <em>Boston Coop Network</em> mailing list if it is a social event
        (such as bike-in movie).</li>
    <li><strong><span class="email-address">bostonareafamilybike _at_ googlegroups (dot) com</span></strong> -
	post to the <em>Boston Area Family Bikes</em> mailing list if it is a social
        event (such as bike-in movie).</li>
    <li><strong><span class="email-address">discuss _at_ artisansasylum (dot) com</span></strong> -
	post to the <em>Artisans Asylum</em> mailing list for events that makerspace and
        hacker folk may find interesting.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>[optional] For social events, notify the <em>Somerville Bicycle
    Committee</em> about the event so they can put it on their public calendar
    and distribute the event notification to all Somerville cyclists.</li>
<li>[optional] Create a Facebook event.  Remember to attach the flyer, if there
    is one.  Contact Val for help.</li>
<li>[optional] Create a twitter post.  Remember to attach the flyer, if there
    is one. Contact Jenny for help (search your inbox for Jenny's e-mail
    address).</li>
<li>If it will be a large, long-running social event (e.g. movie night), be
    sure to notify the neighbors of Sprout.  Employ the rest of SBK staff to
    help.  Finish this at least one day before the event! </li>
