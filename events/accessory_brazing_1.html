<p>Prospective framebuilders or modders! Learn how to braze accessories onto
steel bicycle frames!</p>

<p>During this session we will have a open-ended discussion about general
brazing and bicycle brazing.  Topics covered: tools, materials, techniques.  We
will briefly demonstrate brazing with some scrap, and show off some examples of
finished braze jobs we've done before.</p>

<p>For those interested, we will help you start positioning and mitering your
braze-on accessories for installation on your steel bicycle frame.  Come
prepared with your braze-ons or have them delivered before session 2 of this
workshop!  We have a small collection of extra braze-on accessories (seat bolt
bosses, canti bosses, rack eyelets, etc.) which you are free to use, but the
selection is limited.</p>

<p>During the <a href="/events/accessory_brazing_2.html">next session</a> you
will perform the actual brazing.</p>

<p>Suggested contribution: $10</p>
