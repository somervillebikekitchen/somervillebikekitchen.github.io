<p>An introduction to how to tune up your brakes and replace your brake pads.
We will walk you through how to assess your brakes for damage/wear, clean them,
and align them.  This workshop will focus on rim brakes, but disc brakes may be
discussed if there is interest. If you wish to replace your brake
pads/cartridges please bring them with you.</p>
