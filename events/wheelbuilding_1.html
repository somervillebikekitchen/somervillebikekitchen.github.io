description: Discussion (no building yet)

<p>I see this as more of a discussion and planning session to prepare for the
actual build portions to be held after thanksgiving.  To make sure we
understand what is involved and will have what we need to actually build
wheels.</p>

<p>Goal: Teaching different lacing patterns, making calculations and ordering
the spokes, rims, hubs, etc.</p>
