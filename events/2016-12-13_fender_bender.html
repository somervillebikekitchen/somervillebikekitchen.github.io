<p>Welcome to winter: Swampy streets, wet wheels, and dirty derailuers. Fear not!
Come install fenders with the Somerveille Bike Kitchen on Dec 13. Use some of
our many donated fenders or bring your own to install or modify - we have
material for flaps and reflecting stripes as well to make your fenders really
shine. See you there!</p>
