    <h2>About</h2>

	<p>The Somerville Bike Kitchen (SBK) is a bicycle
	repair cooperative where members of the community
	can repair their own bikes, learn about about bike
	repair and attend bike events. The SBK located in a
	190 sq. ft. space just outside of Davis Sq. The
	space is managed by four volunteer staff members
	and is open to the public and members for drop-in
	hours one night a week.</p>

    <h2>Hours</h2>
    <p>Presently, the space is open to the public and
	members from 6pm to 9pm every Tuesday evening. We are
	just getting started and are working toward having
	having more drop-in hours. Bike stands and tools are available on a
      first come first serve basis. </p>
	
	<h2>Cost</h2>
    <p>We suggest a contribution of $10 per hour for
	using the space and tools. For those with more
	serious interest, we
	offer a $100 yearly membership. Members can use the space anytime during drop in hours with no additional charge. </p>

	<h2>Staff</h2> <p>Presently, four staff members
	share the responsibility for managing the space and
	hosting open shop hours. In addition, staff pay a
	small monthly fee to help cover costs. In exchange,
	staff have open access to the repair space outside
	of drop-in hours. We do not presently have openings
	for more staff members, but expect to have openings
	in the near future. If you are interested send an
	email to info _at_ somervillebikekitchen (dot) org.</p>
