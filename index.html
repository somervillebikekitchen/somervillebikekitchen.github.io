<h2>About</h2>

<p>The Somerville Bike Kitchen (SBK) is a bicycle repair cooperative/collective
where members of the community can repair their own bikes, learn about about
bike repair and attend bike events. The SBK located at 339R Summer Street,
Somerville, MA, in a 190 ft² space just outside of Davis Square. The space is
managed by eight volunteer staff members and is open to the public and members
for drop-in hours one night a week.</p>

<h2>Hours</h2>

<p>Presently, the space is open to the public and members from 6pm to 9pm every
Tuesday and Thursday evening.  Bike stands and tools are available on a first
come first serve basis.</p>

<h2>Cost</h2>

<p>We suggest a contribution of $10 per hour for using the space and tools. For
those with more serious interest, we offer a $100 yearly membership. Members
can use the space anytime during drop in hours with no additional charge.</p>

<h2>Staff</h2>

<p>Presently, eight staff members share the responsibility for managing the
space and hosting open shop hours. In addition, staff pay a small monthly fee
to help cover costs. In exchange, staff have open access to the repair space
outside of drop-in hours. We presently have openings for four more staff
members. If you are interested send an email to

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>See our <a href="/tools.html">list of tools</a>. If you have bike specific
tools or bike-related tools that you are not using, we would be happy to add
them to our set.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>We are not professional bike mechanics. If you want professional advice
about your bike, we recommend that you stop by any of the wonderful local bike
shops in our area. That said, we all like working on bikes and are happy to
share what we know.</p>
