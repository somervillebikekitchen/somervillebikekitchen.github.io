    <h2>About</h2>

	<p>The Somerville Bike Kitchen (SBK) is a bicycle
	repair cooperative where members of the community
	can repair their own bikes, learn about about bike
	repair and attend bike events. The SBK located in a
	190 sq. ft. space just outside of Davis Sq. The
	space is managed by four volunteer staff members
	and is open to the public and members for drop-in
	hours one night a week.</p>

    <h2>Hours</h2>
    <p>Presently, the space is open to the public and
	members from 6pm to 9pm every Tuesday evening. We are
	just getting started and are working toward having
	more drop-in hours. Bike stands and tools are available on a
      first come first serve basis. </p>
	
	<h2>Cost</h2>
    <p>We suggest a contribution of $10 per hour for
	using the space and tools. For those with more
	serious interest, we
	offer a $100 yearly membership. Members can use the space anytime
	during drop in hours with no additional charge. </p>

	<h2>Staff</h2> <p>Presently, four staff members
	share the responsibility for managing the space and
	hosting open shop hours. In addition, staff pay a
	small monthly fee to help cover costs. In exchange,
	staff have open access to the repair space outside
	of drop-in hours. We presently have openings for eight more
	staff members. If you are interested send an
	email to info (at) somervillebikekitchen (dot) org.</p>
      	<h2>Tools</h2> 
	<p>A tools list will be added shortly.</p>


	<h2>Disclaimer</h2> 
	<p>We are not professional bike mechanics. If
 you want professional advice about your bike, we recommend that you 
stop by any of the wonderful local bike shops in our area. That said, we all like working on bikes and
 are happy to share what we know. </p>

	<h2>Location</h2>
	<p>We are located at 339R Summer St. just outside
	of Davis Sq. </p>
